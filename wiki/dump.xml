This is the Atlanta Curling Club Wiki.
To get to our Facebook Group or Web Site see the links below.

We are an active, arena curling club, the only curling club in the state of Georgia. We regularly curl and teach new curlers at the Marietta Ice Center. In the Fall 2014 season (currently going on), we have 3 draws/week of league curling (Monday, Tuesday, and Friday) with 80 curling spots (79 spots filled weekly with ~70 unique curlers), as well as a 4 week Rookie League geared specifically to new curlers with 16 additional curlers.

Please check our calendar or events page at the website [http://www.atlcurling.org Web: atlcurling.org]. 

We'll hopefully be publishing our Winter/Spring schedule and details about a March bonspiel soon.

== Welcome ==
This is the Atlanta Curling Club Wiki.
To get to our Facebook Group or Web Site see the links below.

We are an active, arena curling club, the only curling club in the state of Georgia. We regularly curl and teach new curlers at the Marietta Ice Center. In the Fall 2014 season (currently going on), we have 3 draws/week of league curling (Monday, Tuesday, and Friday) with 80 curling spots (79 spots filled weekly with ~70 unique curlers), as well as a 4 week Rookie League geared specifically to new curlers with 16 additional curlers.

Please check our calendar or events page at the website [http://www.atlcurling.org Web: atlcurling.org]. 

We'll hopefully be publishing our Winter/Spring schedule and details about a March bonspiel soon.

Board of Directors Meeting Minutes 
03-20-2010 
2:00-2:45 P.M.

Directors present: Dan Weddermann, Jeff Williams, Seth Abrams, Abbas Zeineddin, Maxwell Williams, John Farrar.

Director absent: Jason Boskey.

Seth explained that initially we need to do three things: 1) form an entity; 2) open a bank account; and 3) have a presence via our webpage. The Secretary of State’s cost to form a business entity is $100 and we need a $150 to open a bank account for a total of $250. Seth has agreed to do #1 and #2 by the end of the week as long as he is reimbursed later or the $250 is counted towards his contribution to the club.

Seth explained that for the purposes of doing business, the Treasurer would have the authority to sign for checks in smaller amounts. For larger amounts, the Treasurer plus two board members would be required. For very large purchases, we would need a Board resolution. The exact details of this process will be part of our bylaws that we will begin drafting soon.

Seth liked Michael Pitts’ idea during the open house discussion, where Michael suggested we must understand that there are some start-up costs that we have to absorb. As the founding members of the club, this should give us additional club benefits in the long run. Seth reiterated the importance of structure in our organization leading to building up operating/capital funds and growth.

Dan stressed the importance of looking for stones and rinks for ice time. He further stated that he will look into these matters and follow up with the Board. He had already indicated during the open house discussion that he will initiate contact with USA Curling as the club President.

Abbas recommended for us to talk to a curling club that is only a few years old and was organized from scratch just like what we are trying to do. He believes that we can learn from their experiences. John agreed to talk to Raleigh’s Triangle Curling Club, which is a club that is only a few years old.

Dan also asked Max to contact Jeremy Barfield and inquire about the design Jeremy had posted on our facebook page. Dan would like to know if we can use the design for club merchandise for sale or as a promotional tool and that the design does not have any copyright restrictions.

Meeting adjourned.</text>

== Election ==
* A candidate for the Board must notify the current Board of their intention to stand for election at least one week before the Public Meeting.
* The election will run for 7 days beginning at the Public Meeting and ending at midnight on the seventh day.
* Only members of the Club in good standing are eligible to vote in the election.

* Participate actively in e-mail based discussions of Club business and policies.
* Materially participate in the operation of the Club.

== Expectations ==

Hello Jeff,

I have attached to this email a copy of our Arena Curling Starter Kit.  This list of equipment provides you with what is needed to get curling running in your local hockey arena.  You might not require all of the items, but you will need at the very least, stones and handles, freeze on hacks, brooms and sliders, pebble can with pebble heads and possibly the lines and rings that outline a sheet of curling ice.  In most cases the arenas will put the lines and rings in when they are putting in their hockey lines.  Depending on the arena some will fill the circles in and some will just leave the outline of the circles.  If your arena decides to put the circles in they will need a circle cutter which is also on the list.  As far as transforming the ice from hockey to curling, once the Zamboni has resurfaced the ice so that you are starting from fresh, you will need to freeze the hacks in, the hacks are on aluminum plates that you will set on the ice, put water around them and let them freeze on.  Make sure they are secure as the players will be pushing from these as they deliver the stones.  You will then need to use the pebble can with hot water (approx. 90-120 degrees) to spray the pebble onto the ice.  It’s this pebble that allows the curling stones to slide down the ice so this part is extremely important.  Once this is all completed you can curl.  To remove the hacks you just pour some warm water on them to release them from the ice and then pull them up.  Once the hacks are removed, the Zamboni can simply go over the surface again and you are back to hockey/skating ice.  One thing that is important to remember is that the stones need to be the same temperature as the ice in order to work.  If they are warmer they will be hard to throw and will stick to the ice.  We recommend storing the stones on ice if possible and if not you need to let them cool overnight before you can use them.

If you have any questions about the starter kit please don’t hesitate to contact me, I hope I have provided you with a brief outline of what you will require.  You can also go to the US Curling Association’s website to find more information on changing hockey ice to curling ice.

Looking forward to working with you to bring curling to your community,

Sincerely

Kimberly Tuck

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8282">== Curling Camp 2010 Kicks Off Atlanta Curling Club ==
=== Jeff's Original Version ===
On July 31 and August 1, 2010 the Atlanta Curling Club held Curling Camp 2010, its first official event, in conjunction with the Great Smoky Mountains Curling Club at the Ice Chalet in Knoxville, TN. Since no one in the Atlanta club had curled before they relied totally upon the kindness and generosity of the members of the Knoxville club to teach and coach them through many drills, strategy sessions and practice games.

There was a lot of focus on training the leadership of the Atlanta club, since they will need to be the trainers back in Atlanta. Currently the ACC is obtaining equipment and looking for an ice rink in the greater Atlanta area that they will be able to call home.

The ACC members very much enjoyed the practice ends they played. Many members found that curling is a bit harder than they realized it was going to be, and that it really is a game of both skill and strategy. However, sometimes it just clicked and some quite good shots were made. In one end a beginner even made a nice draw shot that landed directly on the button. Afterward he was heard to say that &quot;it was really a very fun shot.&quot;

Encouraged and excited, the Atlantans returned to the south, working out the next steps towards getting their curling club up and running. Many members were also seriously considering signing up for the next Knoxville bonspiel, scheduled for June 2011.

Visit the Atlanta Curling Club at their new web site, [http://atlcurling.org/ http://atlcurling.org]. There you will find pictures from the camp and a YouTube video of the button shot.

=== History ===
Founded in February 2010 while watching curling during the Winter Olympics, the Atlanta Curling Club was first formed as an online community on Facebook, intended to gather together curlers, curling enthusiasts and people who just wanted to try curling together to brainstorm how to form a curling club in the Atlanta area. Indeed, the ACC still has a sizeable presence on Facebook where there have been many discussions about how we should form a curling club, and many interesting articles and links have been published to curling resources.

=== Kristina Whitehurst Version ===
Stones, ice, brooms and a target – these words may sound like something out of the Ice Age but if you’re
a fan of curling you associate these words with serious competition.

Now passion for the sport - widely popular in Canada, Scotland, Norway, Sweden and Japan – has found
an enthusiastic group of followers here in Atlanta.

Generated by several separate Atlanta-based inquiries to the National Curling Foundation, the Atlanta
Curling Club (ACC) has been established and is now taking memberships and holding meetings to give
presence to this Olympic sport.

The biggest obstacle facing the ACC is finding a place to actually curl in a town where no such place
exists – the closest club is presently in Knoxville, TN.

So on July 31 and August 1, the Atlanta Curling Club held Curling Camp 2010, its first official event, in
conjunction with Knoxville’s Great Smoky Mountains Curling Club.

No one in the Atlanta club had ever curled before so the group relied on the Knoxville club to teach and
coach them through many drills, strategy sessions and practice games.

Participants of the event found out that curling, a sport in which players slide stones across a sheet
of ice towards a target area essentially in a shuffleboard-like fashion, was tougher than they thought.
“It really is a game of both skill and strategy,” said one participant. “However, sometimes it just clicked
and some really good shots were made.”

Now armed with all the basic skills, the ACC is searching for others who share their passion for this icy
game. Plans for another trip north are in the works and the hunt is on for a more convenient location.
If you are interested in joining the ACC, please visit their website at www.atlcurling.org. The site
includes pictures from Curling Camp 2010 and a YouTube video of the “button shot.” Also, visit the
Great Smoky Mountains Curling Club's website at www.curlknoxville.com.

Our instructors at Knoxville have asked that we study these pages from the book &quot;Stretching: 20th Anniversary Revised Edition&quot; by Bob and Jean Anderson (2000). Practice these every day between now and the beginning of curling camp so that you will have maximum flexibility when you hit the ice!

03-20-2010 
12:30-2:00 P.M.

Members present: Jeff please provide from the sign-in sheet.

Jeff and Maxwell Williams presented questions and opened the floor for comments and discussion.

'''1) Why do you want to join the curling club? What is it that you want to get out of it?'''

Dan Weddermann: “Curling is competitive and fun. You do not have to be very athletic. You can develop the skills to get to the Olympic level.”

John Farrar: “I would like to be part of building something from the ground in the City of Atlanta and see this as a great opportunity.”

Dixon freeman: “I like the great social component of curling.” Dixon also discussed the book ''Curling: The History, The Players, The Game'' by Kevin Martin and recommended it to everyone for history, strategy and rules of curling. He stated that his ultimate fantasy is to be an Olympian by 2014.
[http://www.amazon.com/Curling-History-Players-Warren-Hansen/dp/1552630838]

Jeff Williams interjected and suggested that we should make a Wiki page for written material and post the book that Dixon just recommended.

Fred Maidment: “I am fascinated by curling, from the strategies point of view. It has very fluid strategies.”

Seth Abrams: “I love the physics of the game, sliding on the ice, and that the ice is the equalizer. It’s all intriguing.”

Kristi Van Buren: “I Curled in Columbus, OH. I want to start again. Curling is very addictive and I almost stayed in Columbus for curling.”

Chuck Field: “I am fascinated by it. I like how curlers have complete control of their bodies when they curl. There’s more to it than people think. There is total body control.”

Maxwell Williams: “I want to defeat Kevin Martin and the Canadians.”

'''2) What companies should we ask to be our sponsors? '''

Seth Abrams stated that we need to have a track record first. We need to have something to offer them.

Dixon Freeman stated that alcohol is a big component here. We should contact some local breweries.

Dan Weddermann wanted to know who the sponsored the nationals recently. He stated that he will find out and get back to the members.

Fred Maidment suggested Red Bull as a potential sponsor. Dixon Freeman suggested Georgia Pacific since they make brooms. Michael Pitts suggested Gwinnett Gladiators – minor league ice hockey team.

'''3) What ideas do you have for fun and useful events that we can hold before we can really curl to draw attention to ourselves or sport of curling?'''

Dan Weddermann suggested Sweetwater brewery. Dan also suggested volunteering for events as club members wearing Atlanta Curling Club Shirts. He would also like us to make the trip to Knoxville’s Great Smokey Mountains Curling Club for an open house and talk to them.

Fred Maidment suggested for us to work as ushers for Gwinnett Gladiators. Fred also suggested holding a midnight broomball in Duluth.

Dixon Freeman suggested for us to have clinics with those curling simulators that Jeff had talked about earlier.

Jeff Williams suggested attending open skates with track shoes and slide-on sliders. He also stated that there is a club in Greenville, SC that may be closer than Knoxville.

Max Williams stated that curling shoes cost $60 - $120.

Chuck Fields stated that we need to talk to curlers when we go to these out of town curling trips.

'''4) Who has connections with facilities we can use for event (cheaply)? (Ice rinks, schools, churches, etc.) '''

Jeff Williams began by stating that for example, with dry curling simulator stuff we still need a facility.

Kristi Van Buren suggested a high school in Dahlonega during the summer. She will inquire and get back with the group.

Jeff Williams stressed that for any publicity-type event we need a facility other than a school.

Paper Mill Grill’s 2nd floor has a large room that could possibly be used for the simulators. We need to know how noisy the simulators are. Also, there is a banquet place next door with concrete floor. A member who works at Paper Mill Grill will inquire and get back to the members.

Someone suggested Meet-up.com as a tool to attract members and publicize.

'''5) What else?'''

Seth Abrams stressed that things need to get formalized at the end of the day. We need to put an organization together, put a Board of Directors together. The main issue is trying to figure out how we’re going to put things together. We need to make some decisions today.

Michael Pitts stated that we must understand that there are some start-up costs that we have to absorb. As the founding members of the club, this should give us additional club benefits in the long run.

Dan Weddermann stated that we need to get organized. We need an entity, bank account, etc.

Seth Abrams stated that we need to get a slate of people with a direction to get things going.

Jeff Williams followed by saying that we need an interim government to have some sort of election to get things going – Should we pick the executive committee? Members agreed.

Seth Abrams stated that after six months, we will have open slate elections.

Next, Dan called for an Interim Board, followed by Seth Abrams stating that the seven people on the Interim Board (positions listed on the presentation) need to get organized to form an entity.

Maxwell Williams suggested choosing and nominating members internally.

'''After informal nominations and voice calls, the following are the members of the Interim Board of Directors:'''

Dan Weddermann – President.

Jeff Williams - Vice President

Seth Abrams – Treasurer/Finance Committee Chair

Abbas Zeineddin – Secretary

Maxwell Williams – Membership Committee Chair.

Jason Boskey - Facilities Committee Chair

John Farrar – Events Committee Chair

'''Next, the following was agreed:'''

1) In the mean time for the next six months, the Interim Board has full decision-making power.

2) First day of fall – We will have elections to elect our Board of Directors. We should be done by the bylaws by then.

3) Seth Abrams called for a decision on a name. Atlanta Curling Club (ACC) was approved by a voice vote. Maxwell Williams changed the name of the Club from Atlanta’s First Curling Club to Atlanta Curling Club on our facebook page.


'''Next, before adjournment members talked about some next steps:'''

1) Michael Pitt suggested that John Farrar could organize a trip to Knoxville for their June event. He further suggested that John research some hotel room rates.

2) Jeff Williams asked the members to keep putting the word out there. He reported that we’ve flattened out on facebook, ever since the end of the Olympics.

3) The production of flyers for distribution to local High School students was discussed. Seth Abrams indicated that once we have an organization we can decide on logo.

4) Fred Maidment and Maxwell Williams talked about outreach to colleges in the city – Emory, GT, GSU.

5) Michael Pitts asked Dan Weddermann to do some research on rinks and stones (lease/rent).

6) Kristi Van Buren stated that USA curling is selling stones to clubs. We missed the first deadline to apply but there will be other opportunities in the near future.

7) Michael Pitts stressed that we need a single point of contact with USA Curling. Dan agreed to call them up as our President to initiate our formal relationship with them.

8) Michael Pitts agreed to design our Website.

9) Dan Weddermann called for a brief Directors’ meeting following the organizational meeting.

Organizational meeting was adjourned.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1470">== Attendance ==
* Katie Vansant
* Fred Maidment
* Dan Wedderman
* John Farrar
* Jeff Williams
* Max Williams

== Presentation ==
Same presentation as last week -- given by Max.

General discussion about registration process - Facebook, Wiki, Registration Page
* Dan: Let's keep the Membership Wiki Page.

Fred suggested that we should use [http://www.kimbia.com/ kimbia.com] to collect donations.

Dan thinks that MIC might be unwilling to let us use their ice because they might be afraid we'd damage their ice.

== Open House Discussion ==
Katie: Curling would be a great activity for me because I have lots of arm strength.

Max: Spoke with Rich Pullman from a northern arena curling club and told him what we'd have to pay for ice and he thought it was a terrible rate.

Max: We need to speak with the people who run Centennial Olympic park to see if we can curl there this winter.

=== Simulators ===
Jeff: So are we not considering simulators?

Dan: Simulators would use up money that we could be using for ice time.

John: It's not curling.

Jerry: It's a good way to keep people interested.

John: We may not be on ice for a year.

Max: We're a long away from actually curling

=== Facilities ===
A general discussion of rock storage and setting up the ice.

Kendrick owes us handouts.

=== Fundraising ===

=== Incorporation ===

=== Events ===
Jeff will call the guy at Torian to find out more about the simulators.

John: Online tournament of online curling.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="784">
* Someone has said that Coke would be interested in sponsoring a Curling Team. We need to find someone at Coke who knows more about this and follow up with them.
* We need to check with each ice arena in metro Atlanta to see what the availability of ice would be and what cost.
* One set of stones can run up to $8,000. We need to start thinking about how we will finance those.
** Used stones are available as well. These may be a bit pre-loved (pre-curled?) but may suit our initial needs well: [http://www.shop.stevescurling.com/product.sc?productId=185&amp;categoryId=27 Steve's Curling Supplies]
** Depending on the condition of the stones, that would be a great start. $4K is much better than $8K.
** I think US Curling has a loaner rock policy and some other clubs might hep, too.</text>

** Dixon called this place
**   Dixon Freeman August 3 at 10:45am
*** I just ordered a pair of beginner shoes from Brooms Up Curling Supplies, based in Connecticut. I had a question about sizes, so I called the guy &lt;s&gt;(Greg)&lt;/s&gt; and he had a few questions for me about our club. But he offered to travel to our events to display his wares and offer advice on equipment etc. The club would get a percentage of any sales. Something to keep in mind when we're ready to have our first &quot;Learn to Curl&quot; event.
**  Dixon Freeman August 3 at 8:54pm
*** Also, I forgot to mention that he sells &quot;club&quot; brooms, like the one's most of you used this weekend, at cost. That's another investment we will need to make for a future event.
** Dixon Freeman August 6 at 12:14pm
*** I had the name wrong. He's Gary Suslavich. His wife is Megan. I got the shoes today. A little narrow and long, but cheap!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="775">*We need a rink! Check! Currently have an agreement for regular events at the Marietta Ice Center. Long term we'd love to get our own space to maintain curling ice, but the club needs to grow into that.
*We need financial sponsors. We are growing our funds with events we have, but curling is expensive. Money will help us continue to improve the quality of the ice and equipment to make curling in Atlanta more fun and rewarding.
*We need stones ($7,000-$8,000 per set of 16). Check! We have 3 sets of loaner stones. We will need to grow and eventually get our own stones, but this works for now.
*Additional ice prep tools needed: Hand ice scraper, leveling devices, thermometers, humidity measuring device in the medium term. Longer term need a powered ice cutter/scraper.</text>

* Paid for freezer repairs
* Note that the deposit doesn’t match up with the cash totals
* Learn to Curls = $1,200
* Stone payment due Dec. 1st (~$5k owed this year)
* Final payment made on the other, older stones
*We are buying more ice now than in January 2014 (equates to roughly $4-5k per month)
===Broomstacking Committee===

* Talked with someone from the Atlanta magazine for an interview.
===Corporate Events Committee===
* Birthday party for ~11 people (paying $550)

* Another interested group (dinner theater people) want a Saturday L2C in January for ~10 people.
===Finance Committee===
* See the Financial Report above (#1)
* Holding off on fundraising because need more club growth first
* Considering if and when to start the stone handle / adopt a rock program
* Palmetto charges $250/rock
** Four Seasons $500/rock
** Green Mountain $500/rock
** South Shore $400/rock
** Idea: put “Buy Me / Adopt Me” tags on the rocks that have yet to be adopted
===Ice &amp; Equipment Committee===
* New coarse pebble head
* Experimenting with new heads and patterns
* Expanding the committee for future bonspiel, assuming we will do our own ice

===Membership Committee===
* Working on completing the roster list (membership forms and waivers)
* Preparing for GNCC membership payment

* Re-order t-shirts?  Use a new slogan and/or new colors?
* We also have Rock the Rainbow shirts
* Re-order pint and shot glasses?  Request for higher quality glasses
* New name tags have been passed out, but money has not been collected yet
===Teaching Committee===

* Rookie League
** 16 people on 4 teams

** Becky sent an email to the members
===Spring Schedule===
* Same ice schedule (days and times) with the option for Saturdays
* '''Action:''' ''Dennis to meet with the MIC - When does little blue go down? This will determine the league length.  How much ice time will we get on big blue after that?''
===Bonspiel===
* '''Action:''' ''Dennis to meet with the MIC - Confirm dates with the MIC and discuss painting houses (or a comparable option).  Can we paint ahead of time? Can we use pivots?''
===Community Ice Opportunities===
* Avalon - New high-end shopping mall opening
** They are opening an ice rink and expect 40k people to come through between Thanksgiving and the New Year
** Could we possibly hold a curling open house or informational session?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7897">==Atlanta Curling Club Board Meeting 8/1/14==

''Last month’s meeting minutes were approved''

===Action Item Recap===
* ~1.5 weeks allotted for reimbursement after the receipt is sent to Dennis and Bob
====Instructional League details:====
* membership is not required
* there will be a membership discount if the new curler signs up during the league
* we will table the topic of discount membership for the Spring 2015 season
* Decided not to differentiate between the social and competitive leagues
====Kael’s data:====
* assign a membership ID using the membership roster (which is the master file that John/Membership will maintain)
* Nobody can be erased, and numbers cannot be reused.  The number would be unused in the future if they chose to not renew their membership
* data will be a work in progress for now
* we need to ensure there is better bookkeeping at this year’s events to confirm which members are in attendance
* Dixon does not have a club banner and has not yet ordered one
** ''John can work with Jon to screen print a banner''
* Membership is now in charge of merchandise
* Merchandise must remain a small percentage of the club’s revenue
* if we sold items online, we would have to charge GA sales tax

===Broomstacking===
* 1 committee member will be at each event
* Free beer, soda, or water with a $2 donation
* the goal is to create a more interactive atmosphere after teaching events
* hot beverages or snacks (goldfish, chips, etc.) might be added to the menu
* they are looking into buying a few coolers- one for each night
* Jon will manage the cash
* considering a brewery tour event, which would benefit the club and be a great recruiting tool
* creating punch cards to buy drinks in bulk.  They will be prepaid to cover the expenses
* We can continue using the warm room for broomstacking
'''Action:''' ''Dennis will bring business cards to the next meeting for everyone to pick up and then pass out at their leisure.  Also leave some at the MIC.''

'''Action:''' ''Caitlin to design flyers to leave at the MIC advertising upcoming events''
===Communications===
* Lots of new twitter followers and an increased presence
* Receiving and answering numerous emails with interested new curlers
* Posting new content to facebook
* Compiling the media to be included on the website redesign
* created a new instagram account
===Corporate Events===
* See Lyndsay’s detailed agenda notes
* Broomstacking idea to have photo booth props with our logo and info on it.  Encourage attendees to take pictures and post online
'''Action:''' ''Lyndsay will get the corporate list from Becky and see if there’s any interest in the open schedule dates
Action: Lyndsay to put together a list of people that can volunteer during the day and see if ice is available and companies are interested in this option''
===Finance===
* Quickbooks is $6/month, being paid for by Bob.  The Board has access
* Looking for ideas and options to make payments
* A new treasury report will be shared at each board meeting
* this committee is responsible for fundraising and corporate sponsorships and will help with budgets
* the dedicated ice model is down to 3 sheets.  The hardest part will be finding a warehouse with reasonable rent (more difficult than raising money)
* Insurance needed for the new rocks and handles
'''Action:''' ''Dennis will provide Bob with the insurance information''
* Fundraising idea: engrave handles or add plaques to the stones with an “Adopt a Rock” program.
===Ice and Equipment===
* Ice painting was completed and about 10 people stayed the whole night
'''Action:''' ''Dennis to talk to the MIC about some new methods:''
# purified water: 50 gallon barrel, pump, etc.
# plastic pivots: been experimenting; want to install 1 tester on the ice; zamboni can run over it
* At least 8 volunteers planned for the league nights
* dedicated people to care for the rocks
* nipping and mopping added to prep routine
* restrict ice prep and the other work to the ice team
* actively recruit for help
* at least 4 volunteers planned for other events with a limited plan
* The focus is ice consistency
===Leagues===
* see the schedule handout
* 10 weeks long, play everyone twice
* people can sign-up as teams, or we can help create one
===Membership===

'''Questions to Research'''
# What do we need upfront?
# How do you support it?
# What are the benefits and risks?
* Develop a presentation plan
'''Difficult tasks'''
# expanding the membership base to support it (critical mass ~ 150+ members, with ~120 needed upfront)
# find the right space
# collect enough money upfront
# Grow the vision and get people to start thinking about it
* Rented space looks like a better model for our needs
* continue to promote the MIC and the support they’ve given us
* MIC signed a new 10 year lease and is still making improvements
* Bob to handle the dedicated ice fund
* keep it separate from the Reserves and meant for large donations
===Equipment Purchasing===
* The upfront cost of the rocks has increased by ~$1K, the debt by ~$2K, and shipping too
* The rocks come without handles, so those will now need to be purchased as well.  Kael plans to buy used handles and replace some of the bad handles we have
* The contract is nearly ready
'''Action:''' ''Trustees to sign the contract''
* the rocks show investment and will have a huge quality improvement
===Team in Training Group===

* names are shared with GNCC
'''Action:''' ''John to look into the privacy policy''
* Google for Non-Profits
# provides access to fundraising tools
# option to create email domain names, but would require some work from Jeff
'''Action:''' ''Dennis to talk with Jeff about the domain names''
* Portland CC uses this service

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14004">==Atlanta Curling Club Board Meeting Minutes 7/10/14==

''Meeting minutes from the 6/9/2014 meeting were approved''

===Committee Reports=== 

'''Expectation:''' ''just a report on what your committee’s plans and mission are at this time. If you have any questions to bring up for discussion or work you have completed, that is fine, but not expected''

====Membership (Farrar)====
# Mission: Grow membership.
# Top priority is to retain the members that we have.  One method is to explain prospective and upcoming events.
# Includes administration of roster, communication to GNCC, recruiting of members etc.

====Financial (B. Hogan)====
# Automate bookkeeping function via QuickBooks, which will provide a central place to document transactions and financials. This will not only help us manage the finances, but also file tax forms, seek fundraising and prepare a long term financial plan. Update QB with prior data and determine how to record data best for the future.  This will be a large, time-consuming effort, but it will be worth it.  QB links to PayPal, bank accounts (SunTrust), etc.
# Develop fundraising plan and options.  Fundraising usually requires financial reports, so QB will be a prerequisite.  Kickstarter is a fundraising option to consider.
# Request to stay up to date on all events and initiatives that require money.  
# Work with other committee heads who are planning events/activities with financial impacts.
# Develop a long term financial plan to assist the committee researching the possibility of leasing a dedicated facility.

'''Action''' ''Bob will provide additional information on QB, including the cost.  Confirm that QB can receive all transaction methods we use.  Can we link a transaction to a specific member and/or event?''

'''Action (Board)''' ''Establish a protocol for purchases and reimbursements.''

===Communications (C. Hogan)===

#'''Mission:''' we want to both increase and improve the quality of communications with current members and potential members, and make it easy for everyone to join in and spread the word.
# Our first priority is to update and refresh the existing Facebook page.  The goal is to use it more like a website and push out information to potential and current members. 
** We will create dedicated photo albums (leagues, bonspiels, social events, etc), add go pro videos, advertise our events, highlight stories and successes, etc. We will also use the FB page address on all communications and direct people there for information and updates.  The FB Group will be linked to the page. 
# We also want to target different groups of people (high school and college students, and other groups around Atlanta). We could even invite the reporters back out again for a follow up news story. I would like to continue the regular email newsletters to advertise upcoming events, recap what's been going on, share success stories, and spotlight different members.  Kael suggested looking into the Wausau Curling Club that runs multiple high school leagues in the northeast.
# Merchandise – Cathy Hogan has a background in merchandise and can assist with pricing and vendor research and purchasing
# Other committee assistance

===Leagues/Bonspiels (R. Eswine)===

# '''Mission:''' Grow Atlanta Curling Club through regular events: leagues, and bonspiels
#Sets up structure of leagues, finds nightly coverage to run league. Chair manages skinny. 
#Setting up bonspiels and informing club of outside bonspiels/assisting in putting together teams for outside bonspiels.

'''''Rick provided the key statistics from the League Survey that was emailed out.  There’s a large desire for an instructional league.  In order to plan the leagues, we will need to know which rink we have, ice time, etc.'''''
* 21 non-members said they would play in a league in the fall
* 2 members (Winnie and Jessica) are not playing in the fall, but both plan on returning to the club
* 23 members said they would play in more than 1 league
* Possible total league sign-up including instructional: 97
* The overwhelming majority wanted to play the same night rather than have a floating league night (68-6).
* League ideas: they would start in October and run through December with a break for Thanksgiving; competitive would be 8-10 weeks, social is 5 weeks, instructional is 4 weeks with 30 min of instruction and rotating positions
* Ranking of league night preference most to least: Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday, Monday, Friday, Saturday &amp; Sunday tied.
** ''Note that some people can only play one day: Monday-1, Tuesday-1, Wednesday-6, Thursday-7, Friday-2, Saturday-1, Sunday-1''
* Most people plan to attend other non-league events
'''Rick’s League Proposal'''
# Conservative: 97 spots
# Medium: 120 spots (where 78 is the breakeven point)
# High Risk: 200 spots (where 130 is the breakeven point)
'''Action (Board):''' ''Define how competitive, social, and instructional leagues differ.''

'''Action (Board):''' ''Discuss and determine the frequency of league, learn to curl, and pickup curling (which helps to bridge the gap between L2C and League play)''

===Ice/Equipment (Stilp)===
# Document ice preparation within the Atlanta Curling Club, including past history, gathered information, future possibilities for # improvement, and bookkeeping of equipment
# Standardize ice plans to improve consistency across events and clearly dictate what different events do for prep (ex: league night vs. L2C)
# Formalize and document training for ice prep at a member level so that when needs for events arise the people running events can quickly find qualified members to volunteer
# Initiate data tracking in order to make informed decisions regarding ice prep on a nightly basis (ex: temperature and humidity readings for each zamboni run)
# Ideas for equipment tracking to minimize the number of sliders and grippers that walk off during events
'''Initial projects:''' ''Purchase/install new equipment to improve 2014-2015 season; use L2T to teach/experiment. General ice prep would be taught at L2T, but there would also be more advanced ice prep classes.''

===Teaching (R Kalman)===
'''Mission:''' develop and implement standardized curriculum for teaching events and ensure instructors are well-trained to teach curling skills and improve the quality of curling at all levels within our club. 
'''Goals for the 2014-2015 season'''
# 1-3 Learn to Teach courses to teach current members how to teach at Learn to Curls.  Plan to hold one class early in the season to involve the newer members (which is another way to retain them).
# Hold several Learn to Curls to introduce new curlers.
# Develop curriculum for advanced skills classes, and plan these events (such as skip school, advanced delivery, etc.)
# Find volunteers for all teaching events. Train members and set up a system or central database for finding volunteers, including qualified individuals for ice prep.
# Promote certified instructor training.

===Corporate Events (L. Rosenlund)===
'''Mission''' To deliver a high-quality, fun, curling experience that fosters the value of team-building, community and lasting friendships through the demonstration of the Spirit of Curling.
# Evaluating cost structure and coming up with recommendations for the 2014/2015 season.
# Designing an experience that is memorable, lasting and will help promote our club even after they leave.  L2C would be the basic format, but look to add something extra such as a giveaway (koozie, pin, group photo, etc).  Some other clubs do a raffle where everyone gets a ticket when they arrive and then raffle some merchandise off at the end.
# Exploring the idea of small group events and cost structure (i.e. high schools, dating groups, etc).

===Broomstacking and Social Events (Burba)===
'''Mission:''' to ensure the traditional social aspects of Curling while striving to provide more opportunities for social interaction for everyone
# The committee is discussing a lot of other ideas right now.  
# They are preparing for the Summer Social Cookout and would like to purchase a keg.  So far, it looks like only 1 life guard will be required.

===Dedicated Ice (D Kalman)===
'''Mission:''' To investigate what it takes to get dedicated ice in leased space in Atlanta - target date Fall 2017.
* The proposal would outline everything that is needed for this model
* Dennis has reached out to Columbus and Evergreen and has received a lot of information.

===Equipment Purchase Proposal (Stilp)===
''See Kael’s excel file for the price breakdown and details.''
'''Stones'''
* The Red/Yellow set is the nicest that we own outright.
* Depending on the type of granite, new rocks can last 10-15 years or 40 years.
* “New” refurbished sets to replace the 2 foundation / loaner sets: ''Would be better than what we currently have''
* They come from Scotland via Wisconsin.
'''Question to address later'''
* What would we do with the loaner stones?  
** Per Rick, Richmond is interested in them.  
** Contact Eddy in Knoxville to discuss handing them off to another startup club.
* We will need to determine what to do with the remaining sets of rocks.  
** Which should be kept and repaired?  
** Which should be sold?  
** This might require sending them away for inspection.  
** Some rocks cannot be refurbished, but they could be traded or sold instead.

* Per Dennis, the Trustees want to keep ~$10,000 in reserves.  That leaves $7,000 to spend.  However, we could take on up to $10,000 of new debt for the 2 sets of refurbished stones.
* Rick advised that most clubs purchase new stones when they move into a dedicated ice facility because they get damaged on arena ice.

===Other Equipment===
* We have 19 grippers and need more.  Kael is aiming for 36 in total, which allows for 1/person on little blue.
* Purified water with reverse osmosis is a common recommendation from others, including Ice King.  This would improve the ice conditions with better pebbling, but is dependent upon the MIC’s approval.
* A new zamboni cloth could eliminate ridges if the MIC lets us purchase it.
* When/if we look for equipment, Ice King can help if we tell them what we want and provide a budget.
* The biter measure and sliders are the last priority.  The measure would be important for bonspiels, but other clubs could also bring one for us.  We have 20 sliders, which is enough to provide 1/hack for events.
'''Action (Kael):''' ''Determine ice painting needs and order the materials for center line and hog lines.''

===Data recording/analysis (Stilp)===
'''''Kael recovered the PayPal and website transaction data and pulled zip code information'''''
* The average order is for 1.4 people
* A large number of unique participants come from the Decatur area; however, members are located mostly in the North Atlanta suburbs.
* The membership and website data doesn’t always match up, and Kael would like to look into ways to remedy this.  A possible option includes giving all members a unique identifier.
'''Action (Kael):''' ''Make a list of what we want fixed for the website regarding data, and determine options for reconciling the membership and website data.'' 
'''Action (Board):''' ''Review the following information prior to the August meeting.''  
* Privacy Policies (L. Rosenlund): It’s Complicated see link below to learn more: https://www.privacyrights.org/online-privacy-nonprofits 
* MailChimp takes care of email privacy ie: hiding email addresses and Opt outs.
* Google documents sharing is also taking care of sensitive documents that could include personal information etc. that should only be available to the board and Trustees.
* We should probably write and publish a clear Privacy Policy on our website and review '''8.''' ''How to Get Consent from Members from the online-privacy-nonprofits document.''

===Pride (L. Rosenlund)===
'''Weekend of October 11th &amp; 12th''' 
http://atlantapride.org/pride/marketplace/vendors/ 
''We are listed as a Vendor with a link to our website. We may want to update the front page!''
* We will have a 10x10 tented Space, 1 Table and 2 Chairs are provided.  
* I need help designing the booth, signs, flyers etc.
* The Hogan’s have an additional table if another one is needed.
* I am looking for a wagon to pull materials to site as I will be staying DT off the Beltline path.
* Banner with current logo or table cloth with logo or both.
* Can’t giveaway or sell water and drinks; however, we can sell merchandise. 
* We need to schedule a L2C after the event and have a signup sheet at the booth for L2C and the mailing list.
* I would also like to schedule a public Social event after the L2C so we can promote the social aspect of the club too. I have an idea but will defer to the Social Committee to come up with something awesome!
'''Action (Jeff):''' ''Update the website''
'''Action (Lyndsay):''' ''Look into merchandise with an updated Pride-inspired logo''
'''Action (Dennis):''' ''Find out if Dixon has a club banner.''
'''Action (Jonathan):''' ''See if he has the screen-print materials needed to print a banner or volunteer shirts.''

===ALL BOARD ACTION=== 
'''''Review the following information prior to the August meeting.'''''  
* Google for non profits
** http://www.google.com/nonprofits/
** http://www.google.com/nonprofits/onlinebasics/

''Assuming we own our domain @atlCurling.org, we can also register for gmail accounts using that address making it easier for us to use the tools we already use and pass them along when we change positions. We can keep LOTS of emails, archiving our processes.
Also, even though I registered us before, our registration expired and we will have to re-apply if we decide this is for us AND we will need Jeff to do some verification processes involving changes to the website to prove our domain right to set up the emails and get started.''

===Tabled for next meeting===
* Team-in-training event (D Kalman)
* Trustee discussions (D Kalman)

Also, even though I registered us before, our registration expired and we will have to re-apply if we decide this is for us AND we will need Jeff to do some verification processes involving changes to the website to prove our domain right to set up the emails and get started.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4974">==Atlanta Curling Club Board: Meeting Minutes 09/11/14==
''Meeting minutes - 8/14/2014 meeting approved''

===Committee reports===
====Broomstacking==== 
* Got cards and dedicated coolers – things running smoothly so far
====Communications====
* Dan O’Toole called everyone from last year that hasn’t signed up for leagues yet, helped us get 4 new sign-ups and 5-8 ppl who are planning on signing up. 
====Corporate events====
* Following up with them from before – some nibbles but nothing serious yet.
====Financial====
'''Action:''' ''Bob to work on the process for daily transactions, money drop, records getting to the right place to record, etc. Need a new system since the old system was wholly reliant on 1 person and didn’t have good records. Financial report later.''
====Ice/Equipment====
* Been doing dry cuts so far – MIC working with us. 
* No purified water system at MIC but will look to do it at someone’s home and bring ~2 gallons/event (store ~10 gals on site?)
====Leagues====
* Discussion later
====Membership====
'''Action:''' ''John has time next week – will reconcile leagues/membership list to make sure everyone paid.''

'''Action:''' ''Committee to follow up and get membership forms filled out for all members early in season'' 
====Teaching====

'''Action:''' ''Becky to get access to sheet for who needs it and determine who to send data to''
====Dedicated Ice====
* Nothing to report

===Advanced skills class review (R Kalman)===
* Good feedback overall. 
* Good ideas. 
* We did it mostly free form – sounds like we should add a bit more structure but still keep it relatively free with lots of people having time to work on delivery and balance. 
* Need to work more on line, possibly sweeping, etc.
* More videographers/video equip would help
* Could do this as a 1 sheet event at pick-up/L2C, but need to advertise and sell it ahead of time as people who show up for pick up want to play a game
* The 9/22 event only has 1 sign-up.
'''Action:''' ''Group to push 9/22 event more, consider cancelling if we don’t have 5 people by Tuesday 9/16''
===Kick-off weekend review (Farrar)===
* Kind of disorganized
* Saturdays not working well for us
* Bad weather, Friday event night before, etc, contributed to disappointing showing. 
* Still an ok event. 
* We should do less events in September next year.
'''Action:''' ''We need a better open house checklist – signage, sign-in person, etc,. Who is in charge of what and what needs to be done.''
===Financial update/2014 finances (B Hogan)===
* Lots of work done to get our 2014 financial house in order. Thanks, Bob. 
* Will be easier and we’ll do shorter monthly financial reviews
===League schedule discussion (D Kalman)===
* Currently 12 for Tuesday, 10 for Monday, 24+3waitlist for Friday, 1 for Saturday
* Motion to delay Tuesday 2 weeks passed
* Much discussion on what to do about Friday and Saturday
** do we cancel Saturday now to focus on Mon/Tues 
** or push it back and see if we can get it going. 
** Saturday seems like a lost cause. 
* '''Motion''' to cancel Saturday- '''passed'''

* '''Motion''' to expand Friday by 2 teams by starting 1 week early, ending 1 week late, and adding 4 single game draws at the 7:30 slot, and having each team get 2 byes- '''passed'''
'''Action:''' ''Dennis to follow up with Jeff to get this all on the website, follow up with MIC to cancel events, and update google calendar for club.''

'''Action:''' ''Rick to follow up with personal note to Tuesday leaguers about delay in start, Friday leaguers about schedule adjustment.''
 
'''Action:''' ''Rick/Kael to develop schedules for Friday on this model – will work with survey of people to make sure we don’t force people into 7:30 draw that don’t want it.''

'''Action:''' ''Rick to open up for multiple sign-ups middle of next week or so.''

'''Action:''' ''Dennis to follow up with people contacted by Dan who want to play and let them know we need them to do it ASAP before spots fill up from multiple signers.''

===Fridges (Farrar)===
* Fridges looked at by “Dependable Services”. 
* Service call was ~$250. 
* Quote to replace condenser, evaporator, tube, and update to new refrigerant was ~$4500 – similar to price of new fridge. 
* Quote to fix leak and refill with R22 was $950 (cost of service call will be subtracted from 950 quote). 
'''Motion''' to fix leak and refill with R22- '''passed''
'''Action:''' ''John to get fridge repaired as above.''
===Pride (Rosenlund)===
* T-shirt signup over, so need to remove that from website. 
'''Action:''' ''Dennis to contact Jeff about making that happen.''
* Need more volunteers for Sunday – we have plenty for Saturday
* Have new banner on order – will use for Pride then hang up at the MIC – it is an outdoor quality banner

=== Curling Bio===

'''Lizen Rosenlund''' began curling at age 14 at the [http://www.curlingseattle.org/ Granite Curling Club] in Seattle, WA. Sheis a vetran junior curler, who along with 2010 Olympian [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Joraanstad Nicole Joraanstad] represented her home club at the USA Junior Curling Nationals from 1995-1999. In the first ever Olympic Curling qualifiers, Bemidji, MN 1997, she Vice-skipped for her team.

After a long break from competitive curling, Lizen found she was longing for the ice and comradery of curling. She joined the Evergreen Curling Club of Portland, Oregon. There she served on the board as Secretary, volunteering her time to support and teach a budding Junior and Wheel Chair Curling program. When a career opportunity brought her to Atlanta, much to her enjoyment, she found the ATL Curling Club website! She joined the club just in time for their first league. She hopes to help the club to continue to grow and get to dedicated ice!

Lizen is currently serving as the Corporate and Private Events committee chair for the Atlanta Curling Club Board. If you are interested in joining the committee and or volunteering for corporate or private events please contact Lizen at the email list above.</text>

=== Curling Bio===

'''Lizen Rosenlund''' began curling at age 14 at the [http://www.curlingseattle.org/ Granite Curling Club] in Seattle, WA. She is a vetran junior curler, who along with 2010 Olympian [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Joraanstad Nicole Joraanstad] represented her home club at the USA Junior Curling Nationals from 1995-1999. In the first ever Olympic Curling qualifiers, Bemidji, MN 1997, she Vice-skipped for her team.

After a long break from competitive curling, Lizen found she was longing for the ice and comradery of curling. She joined the Evergreen Curling Club of Portland, Oregon. There she served on the board as Secretary, volunteering her time to support and teach a budding Junior and Wheel Chair Curling program. When a career opportunity brought her to Atlanta, much to her enjoyment, she found the ATL Curling Club website! She joined the club just in time for their first league. She hopes to help the club to continue to grow and get to dedicated ice!

Lizen is currently serving as the Corporate and Private Events committee chair for the Atlanta Curling Club Board. If you are interested in joining the committee and or volunteering for corporate or private events please contact Lizen at the email list above.</text>

===Bio===
Dennis Kalman innocently went to a Learn to Curl event at Potomac Curling Club in Laurel, MD in September 2010 with his wife, Becky, and they were both instantly hooked.  After a wonderful year of curling leagues and internal bonspiels in the DC area, they relocated to the Atlanta area around the same time the Atlanta Curling Club was having its first on-ice events. They both taught at what seems like 100 learn to curl events, trying to grow the club to critical mass for leagues. Always a bridesmaid, Dennis swears his teams have been 2nd place in every league.  A board member since 2012, he is currently the club President. He’s also a certified Level 1 Instructor and worked to revamp the Learn to Curl program, put together the Learn to Teach event, and helped set the plan for the Open Houses. In addition to the day to day role as President on the Board of Directors, he is also a Trustee of the club, involved with setting overall strategy.</text>

John Farrar discovered curling back in 1988, and with every Olympics since 1998 became more and more interested in the strategy and skills of the sport. During the 2010 Olympics, he joined a few like-minded people and helped found the Atlanta Curling Club. Serving as an officer in the club since its inception, John has seen the club grow from a 'paper club' with no equipment to what we have today. He served as League Chair in the 2013-2014 season, running two leagues, including compiling the Skinny each week. He is currently the Vice President and is excited about the continued growth of the club. John is also a Trustee of the club.</text>

Bob grew-up in Westchester, NY, attended undergrad at Texas Christian University and graduate school at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.  He has been working in the investments field ever since.  Bob, along with his wife Cathy and daughters Caitlin and Erin, have lived in Atlanta since 1992.  He started curling about one year ago as his family decided curling would be an activity to try where they could have fun, meet new people and spend time together as a family.  Winter 2014 was his first complete curling season as he tore his Achilles tendon (by running, not curling) very early during the previous year's league.  He has thoroughly enjoyed meeting and playing with the curlers in the club.  Prior to tearing his Achilles, he attended the Hot Shots Curling Camp in Charlotte with some other Atlanta Curling Club Members.  While there, in addition to learning how to improve his game, he met curlers from all over the Southeast, learned the challenges that various Southeast clubs faced, and learned how the successful clubs even built dedicated curling facilities.  Bob is the current Treasurer of the club, and is hoping that through that role he can play an integral part in the Atlanta Curling Club reaching its long-term goal of its own dedicated curling facility.</text>

===Bio===
From a UHF Canadian TV Station that was picked up on rabbit ears over the Great Lake Erie to a tube set in Toledo, Ohio, Rick's interest in Curling grew.  Fast Forward 4 years, Rick attended his first learn to curl as an eager student at the Triangle Curling Club.   Rick was hooked as a regular on league night and played pick up at every opportunity.  He also took every opportunity to expand his broomstacking abilities.  As a member of the Armed Services, Rick and his loud wife, Maria, moved to the Atlanta area where curling was a limited sport.  Rick joined the board of the Atlanta Curling club to increase the quality and accessibility of the sport that he has come to love.

===Bio===
From a UHF Canadian TV Station that was picked up on rabbit ears over the Great Lake Erie to a tube set in Toledo, Ohio, Rick's interest in Curling grew.  Fast Forward 4 years, Rick attended his first learn to curl as an eager student at the Triangle Curling Club.   Rick was hooked as a regular on league night and played pick up at every opportunity.  He also took every opportunity to expand his broomstacking abilities.  

As a member of the Armed Services, Rick and his loud wife, Maria, moved to the Atlanta area where curling was a limited sport.  Rick joined the board of the Atlanta Curling club to increase the quality and accessibility of the sport that he has come to love.  Rick has had the opportunity to build common curling equipment that is used every time ACC Curls (i.e. scoreboards, PVC measurer, PVC rock box, PVC stabilizers, see a pattern...?).  He has also built uncommon equipment as well: “MINIBROOM”!</text>

Becky Kalman spent a lot of time in February 2010 watching curling on TV when she should have been working on writing her PhD dissertation.  When a friend mentioned a Learn to Curl opportunity at Potomac Curling Club later that year, both she and her husband, Dennis, were enthralled, and instantly signed up for their first league after attending.  After a year of playing at Potomac, Dennis and Becky moved to the Atlanta area where they were excited to see a club had recently formed.  Becky immediately jumped into helping out with Learn to Curl events, and joined the Board just a few months after joining the club.  She has been especially excited to see how far the ice conditions have come since her first event in fall 2011!  Becky is a USA Curling Certified Level I instructor, and loves the opportunity to share this sport with people who have never tried it before.  She is the current Chair of the Instruction and Teaching Committee, and is also a Trustee of the club.</text>

===Bio===
Jonathan was born and raised in Dayton Ohio; he left for a 4 year tour with the US Marine Corps as a rifleman.  He went back to Ohio for a few years before moving to Georgia with his wife who had a contract to dance with the Georgia Ballet Company. Since arriving in Georgia, Jonathan has earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Printmaking, as well as completed an apprenticeship as a Bench Jeweler, which he did for about 10 years.  Although he is from Ohio originally, Jonathan didn’t start curling until the last few years.  He started watching Curling on late night TV and got really excited to find out he could try it out right in Marietta.  He came to an Open Curling event and has been coming back ever since.  He enjoys the game, sportsmanship, and people he encounters through the club.  His current role as Broomstacking and Social Chair gives him the opportunity to continue to help grow the organization while making sure everyone gets the same reception and opportunity to compete and enjoy the game that he received since being welcomed to the Atlanta Curling Club.</text>

===Bio===
Originally from Wisconsin, Kael learned to curl in Milwaukee as a member of the Marquette University club for four years. Since then, he has
earned a graduate degree at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, and
eventually moved to Atlanta to pursue my PhD, which I am nearing
completion of. Here, I again picked up curling with the Atlanta
Curling Club in April 2013 and have been an active member since. As my
wife, daughter, and I will be staying in Atlanta once I complete my
degree, I intend to be a long term member.

With the rapid growth of the club since the Olympics, I have felt more
personal responsibility in the success of the club, which is an
important social and athletic activity for me.  My particular interest
is in promoting learning opportunities within the club, from team
play, to individual skills, to increasing awareness of traditions and
the spirit of curling. With a young daughter, I also have a long term
interest in the club exploring junior curling in the coming years.</text>

===Bio===

For years before founding the Atlanta Curling Club, Jeff had always been interested in curling, having seen it on CBC when he was growing up.  Only once it became an Olympic sport did he get to watch it on a regular, although infrequent, basis.  Once he realized it was an Olympic sport he could learn and play without getting killed, he thought it would be a fun thing to try.  Unfortunately there was no place to do it in his home town of Atlanta.

During the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, Jeff, along with his son Maxwell, gathered together all of the people they could find that were interested in creating a curling club here in Atlanta. Through the entire process of building an organization, incorporation, application for 501c(3) status, acquisition of materials and a facility, Jeff has been involved as a front-line worker and a guiding hand in the decisions made on behalf of the organization. As he retires from the presidency, Jeff intends to be a guiding force into the future as well, encouraging the club into more community outreach, especially in the areas of youth and educational curling, and curling for those with disabilities.</text>

'''BIO'''

Dixon Freeman discovered curling during the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, when, for two weeks, it became an obsession. Constant internet study in the weeks that followed led him to be invited into a Facebook group organized by Jeff and Max Williams known as “Atlanta’s First Curling Club”, which after an initial meeting became the Atlanta Curling Club. 

Dixon remained involved with the fledgling group and its early activities, including the first Learn-to-curl camp under the tutelage of the Great Smoky Mountains CC in Knoxville, TN.  He continued to reach out to our neighbor clubs in NC, SC, and TN in preparation for active curling in Atlanta, and has served as the club representative to the Grand National Curling Club and USA Curling since 2011. 

Dixon has participated in events at Knoxville; Triangle, Charlotte, and Wilmington, NC; Potomac (Washington, DC); Cape Cod, MA; Bucks County (Philadelphia, PA); and Exmoor/Chicago, IL.  He was selected by a panel of World Championship and Olympic coaches and players to be the recipient of the Pat “O” Reid Achievement Award at the Hot Shots Curling Camp in Charlotte, NC, in 2013, with a charge to be ambassador for curling in the South. 

Although stepping away from the position of vice-president with the club, he will continue to serve actively as a trustee, GNCC/USA Curling representative, and member to help the club move forward with its mission to grow the sport, expand the club and its programs, and work toward development of a dedicated facility.</text>

Great Smoky Mountains CC in Knoxville, TN.  He continued to reach out to our neighbor clubs in NC, SC, and TN in preparation for active curling in Atlanta, and has served as the club representative to the Grand National Curling Club and USA Curling since 2011. 

Dixon has participated in events at Knoxville; Triangle, Charlotte, and Wilmington, NC; Potomac (Washington, DC); Cape Cod, MA; Bucks County (Philadelphia, PA); and Exmoor/Chicago, IL.  He was selected by a panel of World Championship and Olympic coaches and players to be the recipient of the Pat “O” Reid Achievement Award at the Hot Shots Curling Camp in Charlotte, NC, in 2013, with a charge to be ambassador for curling in the South. 

Although stepping away from the position of vice-president with the club, he will continue to serve actively as a trustee, GNCC/USA Curling representative, and member to help the club move forward with its mission to grow the sport, expand the club and its programs, and work toward development of a dedicated facility.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3506">==ACC Board Meeting Minutes: December 11, 2014==

===Outstanding Questions from Old Minutes===
* The Social/Broomstacking Committee will be thinking of new t-shirt designs and slogans
* Huntsville, AL is starting a new club in 2015
* Should we offer discount membership pricing for people that join in the New Year?  No, we decided to stick with the $100 price.
* Team in Training previously contacted us to host a fundraising event, but they needed more time.  Dennis agreed he would follow up.
* John is working on posting the privacy policy on the website.
* Jeff unlocked the website Wiki
* The Wiki needs to be cleaned up.  Dennis will work with Jeff to set up the necessary account information and Lyndsay will take on this project.
'''Action:''' ''Lyndsay will post meeting minutes and organize the site.''
'''Action''' ''Becky will update the FAQ section.''
===Financial Update===
* Cash total: $29,000
* GNCC dues and rock payments have been paid
* Currently, we are paying ~$4,000/month to the MIC for ice
===Winter/Spring 2015 Schedule===
* We plan to have more skills classes and Learn to Curls in the New Year
* January events and leagues will be posted on the website soon
* Monday, Tuesday, and Friday leagues – 1 sign-up per person at the start.  As we near the league start date, we may allow multiple sign-ups.  We will also add Saturday to supplement.
* There will be a sweeping skills class in February
===Bonspiel===
* We will have 5 sheets on Big Blue
* The Social Committee is responsible for the theme and food
* Kael has an ice prep plan for Wednesday night, and Thursday – Sunday 
* We need to understand the financials
* It is unclear if we can paint full houses, or if we will be using bands.  We agreed that both are acceptable.
'''Decision:''' ''32 teams at $400/team.  The bonspiel is cancelled if less than 24 teams register.''
* We expect ~$100/team for the raffle
* We expect to spend ~$1,000 for beer/wine/alcohol
* We expect to spend ~$3,400 on food
* Current Ice Cost: $2,500/day  $8,750 total (including a prorate for Sunday).  John to see if we can reduce the overall ice cost.
* We need to go back to the MIC to address some questions about the ice paining, the ice rate, and plans for keeping Big Blue up.
* The Ice and Eqpt. Committee will spend $500 on a power scraper to learn more about ice prep
===State of the Club Handout===
''This will be passed out at the December holiday party, and Dennis will speak to it.''
===Sugar Hill Event===
* They contacted us earlier in the season to discuss holding a curling event.  This probably won’t happen.  It is located near Lake Lanier.
* They would like to have a Monday evening event – perhaps a demo, teaching, etc.
* Unknowns: Can we charge people?  Do we advertise, or do they do that?
* Proposed idea if we were to move forward: hold a 4 hour open house to throw a stone for $10/person with a demo every hour.
'''Action:''' ''Dennis and Lyndsay will work with the contact to find out more information.''
===Other Items===
* Ornaments are for sale - $20/each.  We have the ability to add text to them, such as “Atlanta Curling Club”
* Caitlin has been selling gift certificates for the holidays
* Rookie League Update: 5 people joined as members, and 11 said they might join regular leagues.
* Postponed for later: discuss holding nominations and elections at the end of the season
* Holiday Learn to Curl – John will ask the MIC about availability between Christmas and New Year’s to hold a L2C</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4389">==Atlanta Curling Club Board Meeting Minutes: 2/12/15==
''Attendees: Jon, John, Becky, Dennis, Bob, Caitlin, Lyndsay (phone), Dixon (phone), Jeff (phone)''
===Dennis’ Dedicated Ice Proposal PPT===
* Presentation geared towards the members.  Dennis to present at each league night.
* Complete the project by September / October for the next curling season
** Everything Ice said this was a doable timeframe
** March: shutdown Little Blue
** April: ice melts
'''Next:''' ''strip equipment with help from the MIC (they want to keep the boards); extend/reshape the flooring; excavate the flooring and complete it.'' 
* Currently have 12 corporate/group event requests that we cannot satisfy due to ice availability
* The ice equipment that Dom will be donating will be appraised by the Everything Ice Consultants (references include Charlotte and Triangle).  This evaluation will be provided to ACC and written up as a donation to the club.  These will then be ACC assets.
* Curling is cheaper for utilities:
** Zamboni door is no longer opened
** Little Blue door will no longer be left open and won’t be opened as frequently
** The ice pad will be thinner
* MIC’s motivation
** Little Blue is expensive for them to maintain
** Goal is to make money
** Want to focus on growing hockey and further developing Kennesaw
** Can get money back on ice equipment without dealing with used equipment market
* Loans
====Dennis:====
* Curling Federation – have to put up cash / liquid assets; not the easiest / most convenient===
* Bank loan – backup plan
* Dennis would rather be funded by our members
* funding and grants are an option too, but these have a much longer lead time.  Many are dependent upon a wheelchair program (ensure the new layout is ADA approved), junior program, etc.
====Bob:====
* Bank/Crowd-funding: ~8% and wouldn’t necessarily understand curling
* Membership: have plaques to recognize all supporters.  Do a 5% loan for members.  Can use your IRA, and ACC would pay interest back to your IRA tax-free (better than an individual going to a bank).  Pushback: how do you pay it back?  This is where the financial model comes into play… payback after 2018 Olympics, with the Club continuing to make money.  Or, hold an annual bonspiel at the beginning of the year where the club pledges the revenue towards paying interest on the loan.  The longer the loan, the better.
*Breakout the project into phases with fundraising targets.  Once the funding is available, that phase is initiated.
** Phase 1: dedicated ice and flooring, resolve the ceiling dripping
** Phase 2: warm room (example)
** Phase 3: insulation (example)
===Future Events===
* We need to focus on special events and corporate events in order to support the rent payments and the model.  We would be the southernmost dedicated facility in North America.  Bob has a financial model to support this proposal and will send it out this week.
* Add more Learn to Curls.  They would no longer need to be full to support them.
* Groupon (like Charlotte)
* Sell practice time
* More league draws
'''Vote:''' ''present to membership – passes unanimously''

'''Vote:''' ''formally offer Bob’s 5% loan – passes unanimously''

'''Action:''' ''Dennis to write an email to the membership and our curling friends.''

'''Action:'''Jon Burba will look into commissioning a donation Angel pin with a peach design (Raleigh did something similar)

'''Vote:''' ''continue refining quotes and doing planning - passes unanimously''
===Bonspiel===
* Budget: ice ($8000 total), food (Saturday pig: $650; Saturday side dishes catered for $3/person), tent rental ($1500 for PA, karaoke, chairs, tables), drinks, decorations ($150)
* Alcohol: weekend liquor license needs to be investigated
* Meeting with the MIC on Monday to go through ice prep, spaces, etc.
* Looking into a restaurant for Thursday night dinner near the hotel
* Teams: 13 out of town teams as of Tuesday
* Forecast for Atlanta Teams: 5-6.  Signups on Saturday
* Contingency plan: John wants to extend the deadline by 1 week (Feb 22).  Wait until Sunday (2/15) to extend the deadline.  There are other people that have mentioned coming but haven’t registered yet.
** Contingency plan for less than 24 or 28 teams:
** Cut out a day of ice time, or what do we need to cut the ice cost to $X
** Start Friday draws in the afternoon instead of the morning</text>

The Board and Trustees generally agree on these after much discussion, although there was still some recent discussion around the &quot;no relatives&quot; rule for the Board of Directors spots as well as a proposal under consideration around term limits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="743">Below is the new Bylaws we are proposing for review. These bylaws change the elected Directors to 3 year terms, pass the final decision making authority on to the elected Board of Directors (and therefore the members) and from the Trustees/lifetime directors we previously operated under, and otherwise better match how we actually have been operating with some improvements.  

The Board and Trustees generally agree on these after much discussion, although there was still some recent discussion around the &quot;no relatives&quot; rule for the Board of Directors spots as well as a proposal under consideration around term limits.
